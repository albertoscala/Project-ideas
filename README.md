# Project ideas

Hey guys, this is a repository with a collection of all the cool projects and exercises resources that we have found on the internet.

The main reason we are doing this, it is because we know how hard could be studying CS and at the same time putting the same effort to make the things you study real.
So we decided to make this repository with cool projects and exercises resources that helped us to improve and test our skills aquired during our studies.

# How to you use this repository

All the projects will be dived in the following sections:
- [Problem solving](#problem-solving)
- [Software developing](#software-developing)
- [Web developing](#web-developing)
- [Scientific programming](#scientific-programming)

In each section we will rank the exercises from the easiest to the hardest.
In case it will be a project we will offer multiple solution to help you understand what to do and how to do it.
